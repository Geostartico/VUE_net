Semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds of urban environment is a particularly important task 
since it is crucial for the development of autonomous 
vehicles and can also support urban planning and help performing environmental monitoring.
With this work we address this problem by introducing a novel Deep Neural Network that we called
\textit{VUE-net}.

The name has multiple origins. Firstly, it is an acronym that stands for \textit{Voxelized Urban Environment network}.
Secondly, \textit{vue} is a french word, commonly used also in english, that means "view", which in a sense is the input
of our model. Lastly, \textit{VUE-net} is phonetically similar to \textit{U-net}, which has been the major
inspiration for this project.
