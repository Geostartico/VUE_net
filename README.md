# VUE-net
VUE-net is a U-net inspired deep neural network for semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds of urban environment.

For this project the [Semantic-KITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org/) dataset has been used.

All the details on how to run the code are contained in the python notebook file [VUE-net.ipynb](VUE-net.ipynb).

Results and architectural details can be viewed on the paper [VUE-net.pdf](VUE-net.pdf). 

The notebook is also accessible through [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iEeQ55lBGjo-uBqRx8wtdL2sZd9lo2YR?usp=drive_link).
