For the test phase the approach taken was to compute the probability of misclassifying 
a point in a pointcloud of the test set, which samples were not voxelized.
To compute such value, a backprojection function was needed in order to obtain the point labels
from the predicted voxel labels. The function we implemented directly assigns to each point
the label of the voxel that contains it. The obtained value is equal to 0.308, which means that
\textit{VUE-net} correcly labels 69.2\% of the pointcloud points in the test set.

TO BE ADDED: confusion matrix, prediction time, ecc.
