\textit{VUE-net} was proven to be a model capable to perform semantic segmentation of 3D pointclouds
with good performances. In fact, it was able to classify correctly an average of almost 70\%
of the pointclouds points. Although, it still struggles to recognize unpopular classes.
Therefore, to further improve \textit{VUE-net}, a way to
make the network pay even more attention to these classes than the adopted one must be found.
