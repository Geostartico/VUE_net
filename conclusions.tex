\textit{VUE-net} was proven to be a model capable to perform semantic segmentation of 3D pointclouds
with good performances. In fact, it was able to classify correctly an average of almost 70\%
of the pointclouds points. Although, it still struggles to recognize unpopular classes.
Also, the current version of the model is unsuitable for real-time applications but by lowering the implementation level
of the voxelization and backpropagation phases, the network would be ready for deployment. 
In conlusion, to further improve \textit{VUE-net}, a better way to
make the network pay particular attention to the previously described classes must be found and the data transformation
phases should be made more time efficient.
