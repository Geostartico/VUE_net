Using open3d functions we were able to visualize the pointclouds with different colors depending
on their labels. Figure \ref{fig:visual} shows a pointcloud with the
correct colors (true labels) and the one choosen by \textit{VUE-net} (predicted labels).
As it can be noted, the model easily recognizes streets, sidewalks, buildings and cars, 
which are the most frequent classes. Instead the underrepresented ones such as poles, vegetation
and fences are less precisely classified. To further improve \textit{VUE-net}, a way to
make the network pay even more attention to these classes must be found.
